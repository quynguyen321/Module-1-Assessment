// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.

    const Planning = `Planning- The planning stage (also called the feasibility stage) is exactly what it sounds like: the phase in which developers will plan for the upcoming project.
    It helps to define the problem and scope of any existing systems, as well as determine the objectives for their new systems.`;
    console.log(Planning)

    let AnalysisofRequirements = ` Analysis of Requirements- A good product delivery requires correct requirement gathering, the efficient examination of requirements that are gathered, and finally clear requirement documentation, as the precondition. This entire process is also called as Requirement Analysis in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)`;
    console.log(AnalysisofRequirements)


    let Design = `DesigSoftware design is the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifact intended to accomplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints. ... Software design usually involves problem-solving and planning a software solution.`;
    console.log (Design)

    let Implementation = `Software implementation refers to the process of adopting and integrating a software application into a business workflow. ... Prior to implementation, the software should be selected by assessing needs, budget, potential benefits, obstacles, and so forth. Once the solution is chosen, implementation can begin.`;
    console.log(Implementation)

    let TestingIntegration = `Integration testing is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. Integration testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements. It occurs after unit testing and before system testing.`;
    console.log(TestingIntegration)

    let Maintain = `Software maintenance in software engineering is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes. A common perception of maintenance is that it merely involves fixing defects`;
